# Receiving Webhooks for Programmable Voice

The Telnyx Developer Portal provides documentation and resources for developers building applications on the Telnyx platform. Use webhooks to receive call progress events and notification of incoming calls.

When you send a Voice API command and receive a successful response (i.e. 200 OK), you can expect to receive a webhook. The webhook will be delivered to the primary URL specified on the Voice API Application associated with the call. If that URL does not resolve, or your application returns a non 200 OK response, the webhook will be delivered to the failover URL, if one has been specified.

In order to minimize webhook delivery time, Telnyx:

* does not enforce the order in which webhooks are delivered
* retries webhook delivery if your application does not respond within a certain time threshold.

As a result, you may encounter:

* out-of-order webhooks
* simultaneous (or near simultaneous) webhooks
* duplicate webhooks

Duplicate webhooks may cause your application to issue duplicate commands. You can instruct Telnyx to ignore duplicate commands by sending a `command_id` parameter as part of your commands. Commands with duplicate `command_id`s within 60 seconds will be ignored.

Webhooks contain a variety of ID fields which describe them and correlate them with calls.

## Example: Receiving a Webhook

When you place an incoming call to a number associated with your Voice API Application, you will receive a callback for the incoming call. It should look something like the JSON below:

```json theme={null}
{
  "data": {
    "record_type": "event",
    "event_type": "call.initiated",
    "id": "0ccc7b54-4df3-4bca-a65a-3da1ecc777f0",
    "occurred_at": "2018-02-02T22:25:27.521992Z",
    "payload": {
      "call_control_id": "d14dbcee-880b-11eb-8204-02420a0f7568",
      "connection_id": "7267xxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "call_leg_id": "d14dbcee-880b-11eb-8204-02420a0f7568",
      "call_session_id": "428c31b6-abf3-3bc1-b7f4-5013ef9657c1",
      "client_state": "aGF2ZSBhIG5pY2UgZGF5ID1d",
      "from": "+1-202-555-0133",
      "to": "+12025550131",
      "direction": "incoming",
      "state": "parked"
    }
  },
  "meta": {
    "attempt": 1,
    "delivered_to": "http://example.com/webhooks"
  }
}
```
