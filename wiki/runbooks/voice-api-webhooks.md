# Voice API Webhooks

Reference for Voice API webhook events, payloads, configuration, and delivery behavior.

## Overview

Voice API webhooks are HTTP callbacks that notify your application in real time when events occur during a call — a call is initiated, audio playback finishes, a recording is saved, and so on. Your application receives a JSON payload for each event and can respond with call control commands to drive the call flow.

## Webhook delivery

When an event occurs on a call, Telnyx delivers the webhook to your configured URL. If the primary URL fails, the webhook is sent to the failover URL (if configured).

```mermaid theme={null}

    A[Call event occurs] --> B[Deliver to primary URL]
    B -->|2xx response| C[Success]
    B -->|No response / error| D{Failover URL configured?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Deliver to failover URL]
    D -->|No| F[Delivery failed]
    E -->|2xx response| C
    E -->|No response / error| F
```

For details on retry logic, signature verification, and general webhook behavior, see [Webhook Fundamentals](../reference/webhook-fundamentals-complete-guide-to-telnyx-webhooks.md).

## Configuration

Webhooks can be configured at three levels:

1. **Connection webhook config** — default webhook URL and settings tied to a [Voice API connection](https://portal.telnyx.com/#/app/connections) in Mission Control.
2. **Custom webhook config** — per-command overrides. Pass `webhook_url` and `webhook_url_method` in any call control command to route that command's webhooks to a different endpoint.
3. **Events webhook config** — advanced configuration that routes specific event types to different URLs.

You can also manage webhook settings programmatically via the [Call Control Applications API](https://developers.telnyx.com/api-reference/call-control-applications/list-call-control-applications). Use [Create](https://developers.telnyx.com/api-reference/call-control-applications/create-a-call-control-application) or [Update](https://developers.telnyx.com/api-reference/call-control-applications/update-a-call-control-application) to set webhook URLs, failover URLs, API version, and timeout values on a connection.

### Configuration parameters

| Parameter                    | Type    | Description                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `webhook_event_url`          | String  | Primary destination for webhook delivery                |
| `webhook_event_failover_url` | String  | Secondary URL used when the primary fails               |
| `webhook_api_version`        | String  | Webhook format version (`"1"` or `"2"`)                 |
| `webhook_timeout_secs`       | Integer | Seconds to wait before timing out (0–30, default: null) |

## HTTP methods and headers

### Methods

* Webhooks use the `POST` method by default. Pass `webhook_url_method` as `GET` in a call control command to receive that command's webhook payloads as URL query parameters instead of a JSON body.

### Headers

Every webhook request includes:

| Header                     | Description                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Content-Type`             | `application/json` (POST requests)                                                                              |
| `User-Agent`               | `telnyx-webhooks`                                                                                               |
| `Telnyx-Signature-Ed25519` | ED25519 signature for [verification](../reference/webhook-fundamentals-complete-guide-to-telnyx-webhooks.md#webhook-signing) |
| `Telnyx-Timestamp`         | Unix timestamp when the webhook was generated                                                                   |

## Webhook payload structure

All Voice API webhooks share a common envelope. Below is an example `call.initiated` payload:

```json theme={null}
{
  "data": {
    "record_type": "event",
    "event_type": "call.initiated",
    "id": "0ccc7b54-4df3-4bca-a65a-3da1ecc777f0",

## Response codes

Your webhook endpoint's HTTP response determines whether delivery is considered successful:

| Code          | Meaning                | Behavior                     |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **2xx**       | Success                | Webhook acknowledged         |
| **3xx**       | Redirect               | Followed (up to 3 redirects) |
| **408, 429**  | Timeout / Rate limited | Retried                      |
| **Other 4xx** | Client error           | Not retried                  |
| **5xx**       | Server error           | Retried                      |

## Debugging deliveries

Use the [Webhook Deliveries API](https://developers.telnyx.com/api-reference/webhooks/list-webhook-deliveries) to inspect delivery history for your account. You can filter by status, event type, and time range — useful for diagnosing missed or failed webhooks.

```bash theme={null}
