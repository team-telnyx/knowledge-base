  Google, Azure, xAI, AssemblyAI, Speechmatics, Soniox, Parakeet, Reson8) selectable
  per request, with a single global endpoint and Bearer-token authentication.'

# Speech-to-Text

*Part 5 of 7 — see also: [Part 1](speech-to-text--part-1.md), [Part 2](speech-to-text--part-2.md), [Part 3](speech-to-text--part-3.md), [Part 4](speech-to-text--part-4.md), [Part 6](speech-to-text--part-6.md), [Part 7](speech-to-text--part-7.md)*

Telnyx Speech-to-Text (STT) transcribes audio to text via three integration paths: WebSocket streaming for real-time partial and final transcripts, a REST API for synchronous file-based transcription, and in-call transcription for live voice calls. The platform supports multiple engines (Deepgram, Telnyx-hosted Whisper, Google, Azure, xAI, AssemblyAI, Speechmatics, Soniox, Parakeet, Reson8) selectable per request, with a single global endpoint and Bearer-token authentication.

## In-Call Transcription

In-call transcription enables real-time STT on live voice calls. The audio codec is managed by the Telnyx platform — no format configuration needed.

Two integration paths:

- **Voice API** — `transcription_start` / `transcription_stop` commands on active calls. See the [Voice API STT guide](/docs/voice/programmable-voice/speech-to-text#voice-api).
- **TeXML** — XML-based call flow with transcription directives. See the [TeXML transcription guide](/docs/voice/programmable-voice/speech-to-text#texml).

Engine selection (Telnyx, Google, Deepgram, Azure, xAI, AssemblyAI, Speechmatics, Soniox, Parakeet, Reson8) is specified as a parameter on the transcription command. Same engines as WebSocket streaming.
